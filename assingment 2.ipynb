    "'''Writing and executing a Python script from the command line involves a few simple steps. Here's a guide to help you through the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Writing the Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a text editor of your choice (such as Notepad on Windows, nano on Linux/Mac, or a more advanced code editor like Visual Studio Code).\n",
    "Write your Python code in the text editor. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "Save the file with a .py extension. For instance, you can save it as hello.py.\n",
    "Step 2: Executing the Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a command-line interface (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Linux/Mac).\n",
    "Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script using the cd command. \n",
    "For example\n",
    "cd path/to/your/script/directory\n",
    "Once you're in the correct directory, you can execute the script using the python command followed by the script's filename. For example:\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "Press Enter, and the script will be executed. In this case, it will print \"Hello, World!\" to the command-line output.\n",
    "Additional Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running python --version in the command line.\n",
    "If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might need to use python3 instead of python to specify Python 3.\n",
    "You can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your Python scripts. IDEs like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook offer additional features to enhance your coding experience.\n",
    "Remember that indentation is crucial in Python. Make sure your code is properly indented for it to run correctly.\n",
